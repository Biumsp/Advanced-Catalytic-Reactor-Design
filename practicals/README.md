# Practical Sessions of ACRD

Codes to solve the problems proposed during the practical sessions of the course
Advanced Catalytic Reactor Design at PoliMi.

The files contained in folders named `in_class` contain the codes written during the lessons. 
The other files propose different solutions for the same problems.

The codes often require some functions from the `../solvers` folder or from the `../toolbox` folder.
